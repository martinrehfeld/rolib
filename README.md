# ROLIB (Remote Operations Library)

This one is epic: A cross platform communications library dating back to 1996.
Heck, I even changed my last name since then.

It would compile on Siemens BS2000, Tandem Guardian (sic!), UNIX and Windows NT
and implemented a OSI-inspired remote function call protocol on top of TCP/IP.

Herlitz, a major stationary company based in Germany, used the software for
many years. Every single delivery item passed through this piece of software on
their way from the sales systems (BS2000, later SAP R/3) to the logistics system
(Tandem).

The last binaries were eventually removed from the production systems in March
2011. I'm putting it hereby into the public domain.

Enjoy!
